# Meta’s LLaMA 4 – The Latest Leap in Open Source AI

Meta's **LLaMA 4** (Large Language Model Meta AI) marks a significant advancement in the field of open-source artificial intelligence, building upon the success of its LLaMA 2 and 3 predecessors. Announced in April 2024, LLaMA 4 offers enhanced capabilities in reasoning, context retention, and multilingual comprehension, aiming to rival or surpass closed-source models in quality—while remaining freely available to researchers and developers.

## Key Facts

- **Model Name:** LLaMA 4  
- **Release Date:** April 18, 2024  
- **Developed By:** Meta AI  
- **Parameter Sizes:** 8B, 70B, and experimental Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) versions  
- **Context Length:** 128K tokens (for the long-context variant)  
- **Training Data:** Over 15 trillion tokens from a mix of curated public datasets and synthetic data  
- **License:** Open-weight, research-friendly license (not permissive for commercial use out-of-the-box)  
- **Multimodal Capabilities:** Not native, but vision variants are under development

To put the model’s scale into perspective, LLaMA 4’s **128K token** context length allows it to process the equivalent of hundreds of pages of text in a single pass, enabling detailed analysis, summarization, and memory across long documents—a feature previously limited to a few select models like Claude 3 and GPT-4 Turbo.

LLaMA 4’s training places a strong emphasis on **instruction tuning** and **tool use**, making it well-suited for coding, reasoning tasks, and academic research. Meta also introduced **alignment improvements** using RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) to ensure safer and more helpful interactions.

Although Meta has not released a chat-optimized version like ChatGPT, the community has already adapted LLaMA 4 with fine-tuned variants such as **Nous Hermes 2** and **OpenChat 4**, pushing the model toward real-world deployment in virtual assistants, research, and more.

The release of LLaMA 4 reinforces Meta’s commitment to **open research**, offering transparency in data composition and model architecture—an ethos that continues to shape the future of open AI development.
