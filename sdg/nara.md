## 3. Core Activities

### 3.1 Fetch Maniac
*Favourite objects* – Filthy neon-yellow tennis balls. She chases, traps with forepaws, then prances back.

### 3.2 Dig-All-The-Things
Night-time dog-park sessions end with a snout caked in earth. She joyously presents her ‘mud-mustache’ to the camera.

### 3.3 Urban Explorer
Photographed in the narrow alleys of Jaffa at blue hour, calmly observing the no-entry sign overhead like a seasoned city dweller.

### 3.4 Wildflower Wanderer
A picture-perfect pose among scarlet *anemones* (כלניות) during Israel’s annual bloom. Red collar, blue sky, muddy paws—pure happiness.

### 3.5 Wave Runner
Nara dashes along Mediterranean surf edges, ears flapping, paws barely touching wet sand, chasing a ball faster than the retreating tide.
